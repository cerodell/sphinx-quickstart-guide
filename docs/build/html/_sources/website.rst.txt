Build a Website
================


We are now ready to build our first website using sphinx! 


If you arent already, go to the ``docs`` folder and simply run:

.. code-block:: bash 

    make html

Congrats! The website has been built :)

Let's go to `GitHub <github.com>`_  and publish our documentation page.
