Build a Website
================

First, lets update the `conf.py`
    * You can leave it as is but I am going to show you my preferred set up. 

.. code-block:: python 


We are now set up to build a website. Simply run:

.. code-block:: bash 

    make html

And we will have created our first wedpage.
