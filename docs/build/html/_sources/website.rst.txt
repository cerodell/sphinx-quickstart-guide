Build a Website
================

First, lets update the `conf.py`
    * You can leave it as is but I am going to show you my preferred set up. 

.. code-block:: python 


We are now set up to build a website. Simply run:

.. code-block:: bash 

    make html

And we will have created our first wedpage. 

We will no see a ``source`` folder and ``build`` folder

As the names imply the `source` folder is the source directory that sphinx used to build your website. Sphinx places all built content within the `build` folder.

You'll be working in the `source` folder most of the time.
You will never really need to go into the `build` folder
