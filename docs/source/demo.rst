WFRT Demo
===========

Howdy! Please start by cloning the wrft-demo repository from my git hub account.

I hope everyone has an `ssh key <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_ setup with `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ if not I hope you know your GitHub password and like typing it!
