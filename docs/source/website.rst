Build a Website
================


We are now ready to build our first website using sphinx! 


Make HTML 
------------

If you arent already, go to the ``docs`` folder and simply run:

.. code-block:: bash 

    make html

Congrats! The website has been built :)


Push Repo 
------------


Let's push our work to `GitHub <github.com>`_ so we can publish our website.

.. code-block:: bash 

    git add .
    git commit -m "added docs"
    git push
